# üìàüß™ Data Analytics Program üß†üìä : Story of Jean Plaubert RUKUNDO


## Let me introduce Myself
My name is Jean Plaubert RUKUNDO, my background was typically rooted in Software engineering student. I possessed solid foundation in software engineering, I cultivated a strong problem-solving mindset. My pursuit for excellence sparked the passionate interest in transitioning into the dynamic field of data analytics.

## How would I describe my experience in the data analytics program ?¬†
I had best experience in all this data analytics program journey, ofcourse it was very challenging but worth dedicated time and a lot has been learnt. 
I'm ready to be exposed to daily tasks realated with data science.

## How would I say the Career Accelerator phase has introduced me to when it comes to data analytics ?¬†
Well, we had time of 6 months long to work on different projects, one at each month.
and we used real data to work on those projects.

## What enticed me to join the Data Analytics Program?
Well, I always wanted to know more about data science and I got a link from a friend who knew that I liked data science then I applied and thankfully, I got admitted.
I worked hard to know more about data analysis, and machine learning, Power bi and so on.

## What would I say my progress in tech has been since joining the program ?¬†
Well, Learnt how to work on project at a time until I become expertise in data science and machine learning.

## What are my plans for the future ?
Keeping on wokring on different project at a time while I'm looking for a job and build my own company of tech.

## What is my dream company or role ?
my dream role is to work as machine learning engineer at Google
